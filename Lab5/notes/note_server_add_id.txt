Thatâ€™s a really good question â€” and it comes down to data trust and responsibility.

Why add the id on the server instead of in the client?

1. The server is the source of truth
	â€¢	In a real app, clients are not trusted to decide important fields like IDs.
	â€¢	If the client created the ID, it could:
	â€¢	Accidentally send duplicates
	â€¢	Send an ID that overwrites another userâ€™s data
	â€¢	Send something malicious

By letting the server generate IDs, you ensure:
	â€¢	IDs are always unique
	â€¢	IDs are in the format the server expects
	â€¢	Clients canâ€™t fake or mess with them

2. Multiple clients problem

Imagine 3 users adding todos at the same time:
	â€¢	If each client made up its own ID (like Date.now()), collisions might happen, especially if two requests arrive in the same millisecond.
	â€¢	The server can coordinate ID assignment so there are no conflicts.

3. Future flexibility

If later you move from an inâ€‘memory todos array to:
	â€¢	A database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL),
the database will generate IDs automatically.
	â€¢	The client doesnâ€™t have to change â€” it still just sends { title, completed }.

4. Cleaner client code

The clientâ€™s job is to ask:

{
  "title": "Buy milk",
  "completed": false
}

The serverâ€™s job is to decide:

{
  "title": "Buy milk",
  "completed": false,
  "id": 172263899,
  "createdAt": "2025-08-02T14:58:00Z"
}

5. Example

If you generated ID in the client:

const todo = { id: Date.now(), title: 'New Posted Todo', completed: false };

and sent it to the server â€”
the server might still overwrite it to keep data consistent.

ðŸ’¡ In short:

IDs are generated on the server so theyâ€™re unique, reliable, and safe â€” and so the server stays in control of the data.
